	abstract = {Green Belt policies have helped to create chaotic landscapes at the rural–urban interfaces of the United Kingdom's largest cities. Their prime functions, to control urban sprawl and preserve an encircling green girdle to separate the urban from the open countryside, have created ‘edgelands’ that have been remarkably dynamic despite relatively strong controls on certain types of development. A detailed case study of one part of London's Metropolitan Green Belt, drawing upon analysis of planning registers, reveals long-term trends in land-use change linked to the development controls operated within the context of the Green Belt and the adjacent built-up area. This paper also outlines the history of the Green Belt policy in the United Kingdom ({UK}) and discusses recently proposed policy changes that have provoked ongoing debate about this form of control on urban sprawl and its consequences for the land use of Green Belts and the edgelands.},

The Netherlands is used as a case study because this country has a long-standing tradition of applying such polices and is generally considered to represent a successful example of restrictive spatial planning. Yet, these policies have received substantial criticism in the past decade and are currently being transformed by the National Government.

	abstract = {‘Neutral’ environmental outcomes in terms of energy use, carbon emissions, waste generation or water use are worthy but difficult targets in architectural and urban design. However, the built environment may need to go beyond efforts simply to limit negative environmental outcomes and instead aim for net positive environmental benefits. This implies that the built environment would need to contribute more than it consumes while simultaneously remediating past and current environmental damage. Such development could be termed ‘regenerative’. The potential for understanding and then mimicking ecosystem services is explored for setting goals for regenerative developments, designing them and measuring their successes or failures as they evolve over time. Key leverage points are identified where the systems of the built environment may be changed in order to move towards a regenerative urban environment. Analysing the urban built environment from the perspective of how ecosystems function could be a significant step towards the creation of a built environment where positive integration with, and restoration of, local ecosystems may be realized. Des résultats environnementaux « neutres » en termes de consommation d'énergie, d'émissions de carbone, de production de déchets ou d'utilisation de l'eau, constituent des objectifs qui méritent d'être poursuivis, mais qui sont difficiles à atteindre dans le domaine de la conception architecturale et de l'aménagement urbain. Cependant, il peut être nécessaire que le cadre bâti aille au-delà des efforts cherchant simplement à limiter les résultats environnementaux négatifs et vise plutôt à obtenir des avantages environnementaux nets positifs. Ceci implique que le cadre bâti devrait contribuer plus qu'il ne consomme tout en corrigeant simultanément les dommages environnementaux passés et actuels. Un tel développement pourrait être qualifié de « régénérateur ». Les possibilités de compréhension, puis d'imitation des services écosystémiques, sont étudiées de façon à fixer des objectifs en matière de développements régénérateurs, à concevoir ceux-ci et à en mesurer la réussite ou l'échec au fur et à mesure de leur évolution au fil du temps. Les principaux points de levier sont identifiés là où les systèmes du cadre bâti peuvent être modifiés de manière à progresser vers un milieu urbain régénérateur. Analyser le cadre bâti urbain du point de vue de la manière dont les écosystèmes fonctionnent pourrait constituer un pas important dans le sens de la création d'un cadre bâti dans lequel il serait possible de réaliser une intégration positive avec les écosystèmes locaux, ainsi qu'une réhabilitation de ceux-ci.

	abstract = {Buildings consume 40\% of our planet’s materials and 30\% of its energy. Their construction uses up to three million tonnes of raw materials a year and generates 20\% of the soild waste stream. If we want to survive our urban future, there is no option but to build in ways which improve the health of ecosystems.    Understanding the concept of ecological sustainability and translating it into practice as sustainable development is a key challenge for today’s built environment professionals. The skill and vision of those who shape our cities and homes is vital to achieving sustainable solutions to the many environmental, economic and social problems we face on a local, national and global scale.    Peter Graham offers here a holistic view of ecologically sustainable building by drawing on established areas of knowledge, demonstrating their relevance to the environmentally-conscious building professional and putting the process, product and impact of building into context.    Case studies illustrate how sustainable principles have been applied successfully and discussion topics are offered to stimulate thought. Building Ecology will help planners, surveyors, designers and builders to incorporate sustainability into their everyday practice by:    · showing which styles of building are ecologically sustainable  · providing fundamental knowledge for making decisions using the principles of ecologically sustainable building  · explaining a complex subject in a clear, balanced way.    Building Ecology sets out the current scientific view of how nature works and how buildings link with and affect nature. It provides fundamental knowledge for building in harmony with nature and keeping Earth’s life-supporting ecosystems healthy.},

	abstract = {While urban systems are expanding at very fast rates all over the world, understanding their spatial development remains a complex and controversial issue, burdened with confusion in the literature. A common understanding of the spatial behavior of expanding urban systems needs robust conceptualization and empirical evidence. The physical growth of cities assumes different spatial patterns, usually in the form of urban sprawl resulting from multi-dimensional drivers and causing multi-dimensional economic, social and ecological impacts. The need to manage urban sprawl and its manifold adverse consequences by promoting compact urban development and urban densification/re-utilization has been widely promoted in science and policy-making. However, ensuring a high quality of life for urbanites demands integrative points-of-view for the types of compact development to promote, in particular regarding urban green spaces within densification processes. It is essential to consider the effects of compact development not only at larger scales, but also at neighborhood and household scales to pursue moderated and qualified densification, securing and (re-)developing urban green spaces and their multi-dimensional positive impacts. Urban sprawl and compact green cities require adequate and robust multi-dimensional spatially explicit indicators to support urban planners and policy makers. Through articles of this special issue, we explore in this synthesis paper the current international state of the art in developing, testing and implementing multi-dimensional ̶ ecological, economic, social ̶ and multi-scale ̶ regional, city, neighborhood ̶ indicators characterizing urban sprawl and compact green cities. The articles provide concepts and international case studies for land monitoring and planning recommendations for sustainable urban development. Such indicators give light to capture the social, economic and environmental dimensions of urban development while assessing the degree and extent of sprawl and compact green cities in a global context.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems and landscapes around the world have become increasingly domesticated through urbanization. Cities have been the engines of socioeconomic development but also the centers of major environmental problems since the industrial revolution. Numerous studies have shown that our urban ecosystems and landscapes are on an unsustainable trajectory. Global sustainability depends critically on cities, and urban ecology can – and needs to – play a key role in the transition toward sustainability. In this paper, I review different definitions and perspectives of urban ecology, discuss major advances and key issues, and propose a framework to help move the field forward. After almost 90 years of development, urban ecology has evolved into a truly transdisciplinary enterprise that integrates ecological, geographical, planning, and social sciences. The most salient thrust of current research activities in the field is the emerging urban sustainability paradigm which focuses on urban ecosystem services and their relations to human well-being. While urbanization is complex in many ways, we do know a lot about its patterns, processes, and effects. More specifically, we know a great deal about urban growth patterns in space and time, the underlying drivers and mechanisms, and myriad effects of urbanization on biodiversity, ecological processes, and ecosystem services. Compared to their ancient counterparts, contemporary cities tend to be bigger in physical size and ecological footprint, faster in growth rate in terms of both population and urbanized land, and more irregular in landscape composition and configuration. As coevolving human-environment systems, cities are spatially heterogeneous, complex adaptive systems. As such, the dynamic trajectory of cities can never be fully predicted or controlled, but can and should be influenced or guided in more desirable directions through planning and design activities that are based on urban ecological knowledge and sustainability principles.},

	abstract = {Aim Climate change threatens to shift vegetation, disrupting ecosystems and damaging human well-being. Field observations in boreal, temperate and tropical ecosystems have detected biome changes in the 20th century, yet a lack of spatial data on vulnerability hinders organizations that manage natural resources from identifying priority areas for adaptation measures. We explore potential methods to identify areas vulnerable to vegetation shifts and potential refugia. Location Global vegetation biomes. Methods We examined nine combinations of three sets of potential indicators of the vulnerability of ecosystems to biome change: (1) observed changes of 20th-century climate, (2) projected 21st-century vegetation changes using the {MC}1 dynamic global vegetation model under three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) emissions scenarios, and (3) overlap of results from (1) and (2). Estimating probability density functions for climate observations and confidence levels for vegetation projections, we classified areas into vulnerability classes based on {IPCC} treatment of uncertainty. Results One-tenth to one-half of global land may be highly (confidence 0.80–0.95) to very highly (confidence ≥ 0.95) vulnerable. Temperate mixed forest, boreal conifer and tundra and alpine biomes show the highest vulnerability, often due to potential changes in wildfire. Tropical evergreen broadleaf forest and desert biomes show the lowest vulnerability. Main conclusions Spatial analyses of observed climate and projected vegetation indicate widespread vulnerability of ecosystems to biome change. A mismatch between vulnerability patterns and the geographic priorities of natural resource organizations suggests the need to adapt management plans. Approximately a billion people live in the areas classified as vulnerable.},

	abstract = {Rapid increase of urban sprawl in many countries worldwide has become a major concern because of its detrimental effects on the environment. Existing measures of urban sprawl suffer from a confusing variety of differing, and sometimes contradictory, interpretations of the term “urban sprawl”. Therefore, results from different studies cannot usually be compared to each other and are difficult to interpret consistently. Every meaningful method to measure the degree of urban sprawl needs to be based on a clear definition of “urban sprawl” disentangling causes and consequences of urban sprawl from the phenomenon of urban sprawl itself, as urban sprawl has differing causes and consequences in different regions and regulatory contexts. This paper contributes to the development of more reliable measures of urban sprawl by providing clarifications to the definition of “urban sprawl” and by developing a set of 13 suitability criteria for measures of urban sprawl. Our study proceeds in three steps. First, it proposes a clear definition of urban sprawl that is based on an evaluation of existing urban sprawl definitions. Second, it derives from this definition 13 suitability criteria for measures of urban sprawl. These criteria are useful to systematically evaluate the consistency and reliability of existing and future metrics of urban sprawl. The 13 criteria include (1) intuitive interpretation, (2) mathematical simplicity, (3) modest data requirements, (4) low sensitivity to very small patches of urban area, (5) monotonous response to increases in urban area, (6) monotonous response to increasing distance between two urban patches when within the scale of analysis, (7) monotonous response to increased spreading of three urban patches, (8) same direction of the metric's responses to the processes in criteria 5, 6 and 7, (9) continuous response to the merging of two urban patches, (10) independence of the metric from the location of the pattern of urban patches within the reporting unit, (11) continuous response to increasing distance between two urban patches when they move beyond the scale of analysis, (12) mathematical homogeneity (i.e., intensive or extensive measure), and (13) additivity (i.e., additive or area-proportionately additive measure). Third, we illustrate the application of the 13 criteria by systematically assessing three existing measures of urban sprawl. We conclude that suitability criteria help understand the behavior of metrics intended to measure urban sprawl and to identify the most suitable measures.

	abstract = {Humans’ superiority over all other organisms on earth rests on five main foundations: command of fire requiring fuel; controlled production of food and other biotic substances; utilization of metals and other non-living materials for construction and appliances; technically determined, urban-oriented living standard; economically and culturally regulated societal organization. The young discipline of ecology has revealed that the progress of civilization and technology attained, and being further pursued by humankind, and generally taken for granted and permanent, is leading into ecological traps. This metaphor circumscribes ecological situations where finite resources are being exhausted or rendered non-utilizable without a realistic prospect of restitution. Energy, food and land are the principal, closely interrelated traps; but the absolutely decisive resource in question is land whose increasing scarcity is totally underrated. Land is needed for fulfilling growing food demands, for producing renewable energy in the post-fossil and post-nuclear era, for maintaining other ecosystem services, for urban-industrial uses, transport, material extraction, refuse deposition, but also for leisure, recreation, and nature conservation. All these needs compete for land, food and non-food biomass production moreover for good soils that are scarcer than ever. We are preoccupied with fighting climate change and loss of biodiversity; but these are minor problems we could adapt to, albeit painfully, and their solution will fail if we are caught in the interrelated traps of energy, food, and land scarcity. Land and soils, finite and irreproducible resources, are the key issues we have to devote our work to, based on careful ecological information, planning and design for proper uses and purposes. The article concludes with a short reflection on economy and competition as general driving forces, and on the role and reputation of today’s ecology.},

In this study, we integrated urban land census data and urban district population data to examine the pattern of urban sprawl and identify differences, and to investigate the socioeconomic drivers of urban sprawl in China between 2006 and 2014. The results revealed that China has experienced drastic urban sprawl over almost all of the last decade with an average urban sprawl index ({USI}) of 3.16\%. However, the rate of urban sprawl has decreased since 2010. In addition, regional distribution, urban size, and hierarchy have different effects on urban sprawl. In particular, cities with severe urban sprawl should be noted, such as large and medium cities in eastern China, large cities in central China, small-A and large-B cities in western China, and large-A cities in northeast China. We also found that urban sprawl was significantly associated with urban population density, gross domestic product ({GDP}) per capita, and industrial structure. Further, when the spatial heterogeneity was considered, the driving forces of urban sprawl exhibited different magnitudes and directions. Our results indicate that to formulate effective urban planning and land use policies, decision-makers should seriously consider the differences in urban sprawl depending on region, urban size, and hierarchy.},

We classified Hangzhou's urban development into three types: infilling, edge, and leapfrog growth, and used a leapfrog development index to indicate the extent of this type of urban expansion. We defined a sprawl index that takes both urban land expansion and population density into account to measure the magnitude of sprawl at the street-town level. Further, we employed landscape metrics to describe the change of spatial pattern of Hangzhou's urban expansion. To assess the inconsistency between actual urban expansion and planning, we compared the current urban land use with the latest urban land planning. Based on our findings, we identified features of urban sprawl of Chinese cities that are distinct from those identified in cities of western countries and discussed the role of critical policies that have affected urban sprawl in Hangzhou.},

	abstract = {Since 1950 the world population has more than doubled, and the global number of cars has increased by a factor of 10. In the same period the fraction of people living in urban areas has increased by a factor of 4. In year 2000 this will amount to nearly half of the world population. About 20 urban regions will each have populations above 10 million people. Seen over longer periods, pollution in major cities tends to increase during the built up phase, they pass through a maximum and are then again reduced, as abatement strategies are developed. In the industrialised western world urban air pollution is in some respects in the last stage with effectively reduced levels of sulphur dioxide and soot. In recent decades however, the increasing traffic has switched the attention to nitrogen oxides, organic compounds and small particles. In some cities photochemical air pollution is an important urban problem, but in the northern part of Europe it is a large-scale phenomenon, with ozone levels in urban streets being normally lower than in rural areas. Cities in Eastern Europe have been (and in many cases still are) heavily polluted. After the recent political upheaval, followed by a temporary recession and a subsequent introduction of new technologies, the situation appears to improve. However, the rising number of private cars is an emerging problem. In most developing countries the rapid urbanisation has so far resulted in uncontrolled growth and deteriorating environment. Air pollution levels are here still rising on many fronts. Apart from being sources of local air pollution, urban activities are significant contributors to transboundary pollution and to the rising global concentrations of greenhouse gasses. Attempts to solve urban problems by introducing cleaner, more energy-efficient technologies will generally have a beneficial impact on these large-scale problems. Attempts based on city planning with a spreading of the activities, on the other hand, may generate more traffic and may thus have the opposite effect.},

Although several case studies have been conducted confirming the efficacy of this approach, integrating temporal data with gradient analysis is still rarely used in practice. In this study, a combination of remote sensing images, landscape metrics and gradient analysis are employed to analyze and compare both the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban sprawl in Guangzhou, China. The results show that landscape change in Guangzhou exhibits distinctive spatial differences from the urban center to rural areas, with higher fragmentation at urban fringes or in new urbanizing areas. Due to the complexity of top-down constraints and local interactions, Guangzhou exhibits a more complex, dynamic, multidimensional configuration of urban sprawl that is different from other cities in China. Urban area expanded towards the north and south areas due to the increased population and rapid economic development. Property market forces and government policy led to the rapid growth towards the southern areas. The study also confirms the hypothesis of diffusion-coalescence urban dynamics model in the process of urbanization. It demonstrates that in order to reveal the complexity of landscape pattern, temporal data are needed to capture the baseline as well as the spatio-temporal dynamics of landscape changes along the gradient. Combining temporal data with gradient analysis can characterize the complex spatial pattern of urbanization in Guangzhou well.},

	abstract = {During the period of rapid urbanization, the urban fringe area is the area where urban expansion occurs first, and land use change is the most active. Studying its evolution laws and characteristics is of great significance to urban planning and urban expansion, and the primary task of fringe area research is the spatial recognition and boundary division of urban fringe area. The previous methods for defining urban fringe areas are mainly divided into qualitative division based on experience and quantitative division based on indicators constructing. This research avoids the construction of index systems and the selection of mathematical models and improves the objectivity of the experiment. Based on the existing methods, this research considers the correlation between the difference of industrial distribution within cities and the urban spatial structure and spatial distribution of urban elements and considers the distance decay law of urban density. The urban fringe area in this research is defined as the distinction region of the service and manufacturing industry extending outward from the inside of the city. First, calculate the {POI} density of service industry and manufacturing industry. Then look for the inflection point where its density value drops sharply and get the isoline of that point. The range within the isoline is that the industry extends outward from the inner city and has reached the saturation state. Two types of industries can determine two isolines, and the belt region between those isolines is the urban fringe area. We use the urban fringe area identified from the impervious surface data to verify the result. The comparative results show that the identification method of urban fringe area based on {POI} works effectively, and it can successfully identify the multi-center urban core area. The method mentioned in this paper provides a new idea from the perspective of industrial activities in identifying and defining the belt region of urban fringe area.},

	abstract = {The social sustainability of the north-east Asia has been threatened by the rising population and poverty. The unplanned  metropolitan  and  suburban  growth  endangers  the  existing  systems  of  social,  economic  and environmental   balance   and   creates   hindrances   towards   sustainable   development.   Existing   urban infrastructure  has  become  unable  to  cater  services to  all  citizens  resulting  poor  quality  of  life.  Thegovernment is also struggling to pay for new and expanded services. Most of the existing metropolitan cities in  the  south-east  Asia  were  not  planned  how  to  face  these  kinds  of  problems  when  it  arise.  Contemporary policy  problems  are  to  be  found  in  the  rural  areas of  this  region  which  act  as  hindrances  of  the  city expansion. In most of the cases the existing metropolitan cities expand without any proper guidelines where the  cities  hardly  breathe.  The  people  living  in  urban  fringe  areas  are  contributing  to  the  economy;  they  are more susceptible to social, economic and environmental shocks generated within the region. The Fringe area Development  may  be  a  solution  to  these  growing  problems  in  this  region.  Urban  Fringe  is  an  area  that situates  between  urban  and  rural  system.  Fringe  is defined  as  a  relation  to  the city  and  exists  in agriculture hinterland  (area  around  or  beyond  a  major  town)  where  land  use  is  changing  .It  is  the  most  sensitive, dynamic  and  swiftly  changing  area  during  the  urbanization  process.  However  to  minimize  the  growing development  pressure  of  the  metropolis  emergence  of  fringe  area  development  has  become  popular  to decentralize  the  population  in  this  region.  But  at the  same  time  the  development  without  proper  guidelines results  poor  services  in  the  fringe  areas  which  has  become  a  common  phenomenon  in  the  region  and  it gradually attempts to destroy the overall infrastructure and environment of the metropolis.  In 2015 the {UNDP} has formed certain global goals known as “Sustainable Development Goals”. The motto of the {SDGs} is “To provide a better future for everyone of the society”. However it is noticeable that in most of  the  cases  the  fringe  area  development  in  this  region  is  basically  focused  to  cope  up  with  the  present scenario; either focuses on social or economic or environmental benefit. But to achieve the {SDG} it should be focused  on  these  three  perspectives  equally.  In  Indian  context  the  fringe  area  development  is  focused to decrease and decentralize the pressure of the mother city. Thus it is hardly seen to achieve the {SDG} in Indian scenario.  In  the  contrast  in  the  developed  countries  the  fringe  area  development  hardly  neglects  any  of  the three perspectives of the sustainability as the cities are already developed in every aspect that the fringe area development does not require to decrease and decentralize the pressure of the mother city. So the fringe area development in developed countries is more likely policy oriented whereas in south-east Asian context it is more  likely  depends  on  the  nature  and  characteristics  of  the  mother  city.  .  This  paper  aims  how  far  is  it applicable  to  induce  the  {SDGs}  in  the  fringe  areas  in  Indian  scenario  so  that  it  may  draw  sustainability  in these metropolitan cities as well as in the fringe area.},

Though abundant studies exist, little is known regarding either the sprawl of small and medium-sized cities or the difference in sprawl degree among cities of different sizes. Taking a case of Chinese cities, this paper aims to compare sprawl degree among cities of different sizes. Using land use data and population census data from 2000 to 2010, we quantified urban sprawl by two metrics to reflect the characteristics of sprawl in quantity and morphology, respectively. We observed that small and medium-sized cities, in general, sprawled the most followed by large cities, while mega cities sprawled the least. There were also regional differences: the Eastern region had similar characteristics with the whole sample, while large cities in the Central region and mega cities in the Western region had a relatively high sprawl degree. The low commuting cost and land price in small and medium-sized cities may contribute to their high sprawl degree. In China, some institutional and economic development factors, including the loose urban planning, favorable national policy, industry-oriented growth pattern and land finance system, also have some explanatory power. According to our findings, we suggest that the sprawl of small and medium-sized cities should draw further attention by scholars and governors, especially how to deal with the sprawl problem in these cities.},

This research establishes a multidimensional index which combines city expansion, urban compactness and urban form to measure sprawl. Urban planning, as part of the state-led growth approach, has exerted dramatic impact on city growth in China. Recent studies have discussed the role of planning in city growth. However, measuring the impact of planning on sprawl, has not been conducted. Taking Shanghai as a case study, this paper builds a multidimensional index to measure the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban sprawl in Shanghai from 1990 to 2010. It finds that urban sprawl was more serious in 2000s than in the 1990s, and the sprawl also presents spatial heterogeneity within different areas of the city. While quantifying the role of planning in urban sprawl, this study adopts the Geo-Detector based on spatial variation analysis of the geographical strata in order to assess the impact of planning on urban sprawl. It finds that planning is strongly correlated with urban sprawl, in other words, urban sprawl is kind of a "planned sprawl" in Shanghai. The research concludes with future planning policies necessary for a more sustainable and compact development pattern.},

This research begins with definitions of sprawl in Western and Eastern countries, and follows with a dynamic analysis of the social, political, and cultural aspects of sprawl. Three case studies focus on three urban regions in China: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. This research provides a comprehensive definition of “urban sprawl” in China, identifies the patterns of urban sprawl and growth, and indicates possible alternative strategies for urban expansion.

Along each profile from central city to suburb,the inner boundary of a rural-urban fringe is where a mutation point group appears, while the external boundary is where mutation point group disappears. Wuhan is experiencing rapid urbanization, and therefore were chosen to implement a case study. The db3 Daubechies wavelet function was selected as the mother wavelet, and wavelet transform was scale 3.

	abstract = {Urban–rural fringe, which form a link between urban construction areas and rural hinterland, is the most sensitive area to urbanization. Its accurate identification is of great significance for the further study of urbanization related socio–economic and eco-environmental changes in the perspective of urban–rural contrast. Previous studies of urban–rural fringe identification had problems with narrow scope of application, low efficiency of identification, and the results were greatly influenced by subjective factors. Nighttime light, as an important product of human activities, can reflect the gradient changes of urban–rural landscapes, and can be used to identify urban–rural fringes. Therefore, a K–means–based approach was developed using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System ({DMSP}/{OLS}) nighttime light data. Taking Beijing City as an example, in this study we delineated its urban–rural fringes. Our results indicate that a ring–shaped urban–rural fringe surrounds urban central areas, with an area of 3712 km2, which is mainly located in new urban development zones. Inside the urban–rural fringe, lights fluctuated obviously, and the fluctuation index was up to 76.75. Meanwhile, the combination of nighttime light intensity and light fluctuation had better performance than that when they were considered separately in the identification of urban–rural fringes. Furthermore, the K–means algorithm based on nighttime light found more details related to urban–rural fringes when compared with the traditional mutation detection method. This study provided an approach to identifying urban–rural fringes accurately and objectively, which is conducive to the study of eco–environmental effects in the process of urbanization.},

	abstract = {Since the late 1990s, remotely sensed night-time lights ({NTL}) satellite imagery has been shown to correlate with socioeconomic parameters including urbanization, economic activity, and population. More recent research demonstrates that multitemporal {NTL} data can serve as a reliable proxy for change over time in these variables whether they are increasing or decreasing. Time series analysis of {NTL} data is especially valuable for detecting, estimating, and monitoring socioeconomic dynamics in countries and subnational regions where reliable official statistics may be lacking. Until 2012, multitemporal {NTL} imagery came primarily from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program - Operational Linescan System ({DMSP}-{OLS}), for which digital imagery is available from 1992 to 2013. In October 2011, the launch of {NASA}/{NOAA}'s Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, whose Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ({VIIRS}) sensor has a Day/Night Band ({DNB}) specifically designed for capturing radiance from the Earth at night, marked the start of a new era in {NTL} data collection and applications. In light of these advances, this paper reviews progress in using multitemporal {DMSP}-{OLS} and {VIIRS} imagery to analyze urbanization, economic, and population dynamics across a range of geographic scales. An overview of data corrections and processing for comparison of multitemporal {NTL} imagery is provided, followed by a meta-analysis and integrative synthesis of these studies. Figures are included that visualize the capabilities of {DMSP}-{OLS} and {VIIRS} to capture socioeconomic change in the post-Soviet Russian Far East and war-torn Syria, respectively. Finally, future directions for {NTL} research are suggested, particularly in the areas of determining the fundamental causes of observed light and in leveraging {VIIRS}' superior sensitivity and spatial and radiometric resolution.},

Rather, urban areas in different regions of the world are undergoing myriad types of transformation processes. The purpose of this paper is to examine how well data from {DMSP}/{OLS} nighttime lights ({NTL}) can identify different types of urbanization processes. Although data from {DMSP}/{OLS} {NTL} are increasingly used for the study of urban areas, to date there is no systematic assessment of how well these data identify different types of urban change. Here, we randomly select 240 sample locations distributed across all world regions to generate urbanization typologies with the {DMSP}/{OLS} {NTL} data and use Google Earth imagery to assess the validity of the {NTL} results. Our results indicate that where urbanization occurred, {NTL} have a high accuracy (93\%) of characterizing these changes. There is also a relatively high error of commission (42\%), where {NTL} identified urban change when no change occurred. This leads to an overestimation of urbanization by {NTL}. Our analysis shows that time series {NTL} data more accurately identifies urbanization in developed countries, but is less accurate in developing countries, suggesting the need to exert caution when using or interpreting {NTL} in developing countries.},

	abstract = {Spatial identification of the urban-rural fringes is very significant for deeply understanding the development processes and regulations of urban space and guiding urban spatial development in the future. Traditionally, urban-rural fringe areas are identified using statistical analysis methods that consider indexes from single or multiple factors, such as population densities, the ratio of building land, the proportion of the non-agricultural population, and economic levels. However, these methods have limitations, for example, the statistical data are not continuous, the statistical standards are not uniform, the data is seldom available in real time, and it is difficult to avoid issues on the statistical effects from edges of administrative regions or express the internal differences of these areas. This paper proposes a convenient approach to identify the urban-rural fringe using nighttime light data of {DMSP}/{OLS} images. First, a light characteristics–combined value model was built in {ArcGIS} 10.3, and the combined characteristics of light intensity and the degree of light intensity fluctuation are analyzed in the urban, urban-rural fringe, and rural areas. Then, the Python programming language was used to extract the breakpoints of the characteristic combination values of the nighttime light data in 360 directions taking Tian An Men as the center. Finally, the range of the urban-rural fringe area is identified. The results show that the urban-rural fringe of Beijing is mainly located in the annular band around Tian An Men. The average inner radius is 19 km, and the outer radius is 26 km. The urban-rural fringe includes the outer portions of the four city center districts, which are the Chaoyang District, Haidian District, Fengtai District, and Shijingshan District and the part area border with Daxing District, Tongzhou District, Changping District, Mentougou District, Shunyi District, and Fangshan District. The area of the urban-rural fringe is approximately 765 km2. This paper provides a convenient, feasible, and real-time approach for the identification of the urban-rural fringe areas. It is very significant to extract the urban-rural fringes.},

In this study we aim to use location-based social media big data to challenge the primacy of {NTL} imagery on estimating socioeconomic factors. Geo-tagged tweets posted in the contiguous United States in 2013 were retrieved to produce a tweet image with the same spatial resolution of the {NTL} imagery (i.e., 0.00833° × 0.00833°). Sum tweet (the total number of tweets) and sum light (summed {DN} value of the {NTL} image) of each state or county were obtained from the tweets and the {NTL} images, respectively, to estimate three important socioeconomic factors: personal income, electric power consumption, and fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that sum tweet is a better measure of personal income and electric power consumption while carbon dioxide emissions can be more accurately estimated by sum light. We further exploited that African-Americans adults are more likely than White seniors to post geotagged tweets in the {US}, yet did not find any significant correlations between proportions of the subpopulations and the estimation accuracy of the socioeconomic factors. Existence of saturated pixels and blooming effects and failure to remove gas flaring reduce quality of {NTL} imagery in estimating socioeconomic factors, however, such problems are nonexistent in the tweet images. This study reveals that the number of geo-tagged tweets has great potential to be deemed as a substitute of brightness of {NTL} to assess socioeconomic factors over large geographic areas.},

This is because remotely sensed {NTL} signals can be quantitatively connected to demographic and socioeconomic variables at regional and global scales. The recently composited cloud-free {NTL} imagery derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ({VIIRS}) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-{NPP}) satellite provides spatially detailed observations of human settlements. We quantitatively estimated socioeconomic development inequalities across 30 provinces and municipalities in mainland China using {VIIRS} {NTL} data associated with both regional gross domestic product ({GDP}) and population census data. We quantitatively investigated relations between {NTL}, {GDP}, and population using a linear regression model. Our results suggest that {NTL} radiances have significant positive correlations with {GDP} and population at different levels. Several inequality coefficients, commonly used in economics, were derived from {VIIRS} {NTL} data and statistical data at multiple spatial scales. Compared with the statistical data, {NTL}-derived inequality coefficients enabled us to elicit more detailed information on differences in regional development at multiple levels. Our study of provinces and municipalities revealed that county-level inequality was more significant than city-level inequality. The results of population-weighted {NTL} inequality indicate an obvious regional disparity with {NTL} distribution being more unequal in China’s undeveloped western regions compared with more developed eastern regions. Our findings suggest that given the timely and spatially explicit advantages of {VIIRS}, {NTL} data are capable of providing comprehensive information regarding inequality at multiple levels, which is not possible through the use of traditional statistical sources.},

Therefore, evaluation of the existing compactness of urban areas is crucial for guiding future urban development. Previous studies measured urban areas' compactness at a city or metropolitan scale in a developed country context. Hence, a considerable research gap exists in studying compactness at the neighborhood scale, especially in urban areas from a developing country. This paper aims to evaluate and compare compactness level of neighborhoods in the {GIS} environment through broadly six indicators-population density, evenness of development, clustering nature of development, land-use diversity, floor use mix, and road network connectivity in eight neighborhoods of Dhaka city, Bangladesh. For this, the study developed a Composite Compactness Index ({CCI}) based on a multi-criteria decision-making ({MCDM}) approach. Study results classified four neighborhood as low compact, three as moderately compact, and one as high compact neighborhood. Travel behavior analysis through modal share, travel time, and travel distance validated compact neighborhoods' tenability. Here, identified low and moderate compact neighborhoods require immediate planning interventions for improving their compactness level. Results from this study can work as a preliminary guideline for planners, policymakers, and development agencies for designing a more sustainable and efficient urban form through compact urban development on neighborhood scale. The developed methodology presented here can be applied to other areas with refinements necessary for corresponding geographic location.},

Subsequently, principal component and cluster analysis are applied to build the composite index. Two baseline scenarios and three hypothetical policy alternatives, run from 2000 to 2030 using the pan-European {EU}-{ClueScanner} 1km resolution land use model are then used to test the sensitivity and robustness of the composite index in large urban zones ({LUZs}). The second part of the paper is dedicated to the spatial analysis of a subset of large urban zones with the largest area growth in all the model runs for the year 2030. The landscape context of all built-up land in the year 2000 is analysed for the newly created urban land. It is characterised according to the proportion of natural, agricultural, built-up areas within a 7km radius. A stepwise multiple regression analysis relating the landscape mosaic types and the composite index allowed us to understand whether or not the landscape surrounding the existing urban cores acts as the driving force responsible for the more “successful” policy alternatives in terms of urban compactness. Modellers may consider the landscape mosaic as one possible proxy to determine which urban areas are more likely to have less compact urban expansion patterns for scenarios with an increase in land claims for built-up areas.},

The ecosystem model used in this study was Sim-{CYCLE}, with which {LAI} retrieved from the data acquired by {MODIS} sensor ({MODIS}-{LAI}) was integrated. Global annual {NPP} was estimated as 59.6 Gt C year−1 by {MOD}-Sim-{CYCLE} (Sim-{CYCLE} after integration of {MODIS}-{LAI}), whereas it was 62.7 Gt C year−1 in case of Sim-{CYCLE} for the year 2001. Both models predicted highest {NPP} around the equator with another smaller peak occurring around 60°N. These two regions represented the tropical and boreal forests biomes, respectively. The {NPP} estimated by {MOD}-Sim-{CYCLE} exceeded the {NPP} estimated by Sim-{CYCLE} in these two regions. Other than the tropical and boreal forests biomes, {NPP} values estimated by the {MOD}-Sim-{CYCLE} were typically lower than Sim-{CYCLE} across the latitudes. Validations of results in Australia and {USA} showed that {MOD}-Sim-{CYCLE} estimated {NPP} more accurately than Sim-{CYCLE}. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining satellite-observation with an ecosystem process model to achieve improved accuracy in estimates and monitoring global net primary productivity.},

	abstract = {Dryland ecosystems are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Monitoring is vital in order to evaluate their response to fluctuating rainfall and temperature patterns for long-term ecosystem safeguarding. Monitoring of long term changes of normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) and climate variables are fundamental for better understanding of change trajectories in dryland ecosystem, and to ascertain their potential interaction with anthropogenic drivers. In this study, we identify determinant factors of dryland changes by using {MODIS} {NDVI}, precipitation and temperature data for Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend ({BFAST}) and Mann Kendall test statistic. {BFAST} predicts iteratively time and number of changes within a time series data to depict the size and direction of changes. Analysis of {NDVI}, precipitation and temperature time series data showed substantial changes during the study period of 2000–2014. There is a reduction trend in vegetation showed by the decline in {NDVI}, with significant breakpoints till 2009 and recovery afterwards, without a significant change in annual trends of precipitation (α {\textless} 0.05) for the same study period. Furthermore 2 positive climate trends were founded: a) a significant positive trend on long term annual rainfall during the main rainy seasons and; 2) a significant (α {\textless} 0.05) annual increment of the long term mean minimum and mean maximum temperature of 0.03 °C/year and 0.04 °C/year, respectively. This assessment showed that climate variables cannot be considered as the main factors in explaining the observed patterns of vegetation dynamics. Seasonal and interannual precipitation changes have a lower weight as driving factors for the reduction in vegetation trends. Hence, the decline in vegetation productivity of the region can be attributed to the increasing pressure of human activities.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem energy has been shown to be a strong correlate with biological diversity at continental scales. Early efforts to characterize this association used the normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) to represent ecosystem energy. While this spectral vegetation index covaries with measures of ecosystem energy such as net primary production, the covariation is known to degrade in areas of very low vegetation or in areas of dense forest. Two of the new vegetation products from the {MODIS} sensor, derived by integrating spectral reflectance, climate data, and land cover, are thought to better approximate primary productivity than {NDVI}. In this study, we determine if the new {MODIS} derived measures of primary production, gross primary productivity ({GPP}) and net primary productivity ({NPP}) better explain variation in bird richness than historically used {NDVI}. Moreover, we evaluate if the two productivity measures covary more strongly with bird diversity in those vegetation conditions where limitations of {NDVI} are well recognized. Biodiversity was represented as native landbird species richness derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Analyses included correlation analyses among predictor variables, and univariate regression analyses between each predictor variable and bird species richness. Analyses were done at two levels: for all {BBS} routes across natural landscapes in North America; and for routes in 10 vegetation classes stratified by vegetated cover along a gradient from bare ground to herbaceous cover to tree cover. We found that {NDVI}, {GPP} and {NPP} were highly correlated and explained similar variation in bird species richness when analyzed for all samples across North America. However, when samples were stratified by vegetated cover, strength of correlation between {NDVI} and both productivity measures was low for samples with bare ground and for dense forest. The {NDVI} also explained substantially less variation in bird species richness than the primary production in areas with more bare ground and in areas of dense forest. We conclude that {MODIS} productivity measures have higher utility in studies of the relationship of species richness and productivity and that {MODIS} {GPP} and {NPP} improve on {NDVI}, especially for studies with large variation in vegetated cover and density.},

Estimates of {NPP} for the tropical zone — seasonal rainforests and rainforests — were highest, ranging from 20 to 24 Mg ha−1 year−1. {NPP} was lowest in boreal zone forests comprised primarily of Scotch pine and Siberian pine, averaging only 6.7 Mg ha−1 year−1.

Through acidification by wet deposition, {PM}2.5 can cause acid rain to impact aquatic ecosystems. However, our understanding of {PM}2.5 effect on ecosystem functioning is highly limited. This study investigated the relationship between {PM}2.5 concentration, associated acidity, and leaf litter breakdown of three tree species in laboratory experimental mesocosms, which are weeping willow (Salix babylonica), camphor tree(Cinnamomum camphora), and the south magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). We found that leaf litter breakdown was significant affected by {PM}2.5 and associated acidity. With the increase of acidity, the leaf breakdown rate of all three tree species decreased. With the increase of {PM}2.5 concentration, the leaf breakdown rates of those leaves slowed down. When considering the influence of leaf toughness, willow leaves with lower toughness had a higher breakdown rate than that of camphor tree and the south magnolia. Our study suggests that {PM}2.5 has significant impact on the aquatic ecosystem functioning through increasing acidification in aquatic environment. Hence, along with ecological restoration of local aquatic habitats, further freshwater ecosystem management should include reducing air pollution through regional efforts of best ecosystem management.},

Therefore, it is important to understand how to scientiﬁcally and rationally construct green space ecological networks, connect fragmented habitats, and protect biodiversity and regional ecological security. Here, we used geographic information system and remote sensing technology to address the ecological sources via morphological spatial pattern analysis and ecological connectivity index analysis methods. The minimum cost distance method was used to generate a potential corridor. The green space ecological network system of the study area was constructed based on its green space landscape pattern. Qualitative and quantitative analysis provided targeted recommendations for green space ecological network optimization in the study area. The results showed that in the study area, the level of the fragmentation was high. Although the number of urban green space patches was signiﬁcant, the area of the patches was small. Despite the potential corridor not covering the study area evenly, the optimized green space corridor increased the secondary ecological source area. The network system for green space corridors comprised water corridors, road corridors, and ecological restoration sites.},

Nature-based solutions directly address and contribute to increased urban resilience. However, implementing nature-based solutions is inherently complex, given the range of ecosystem services, their multi-functionality and the trade-offs between functions, and across temporal and spatial scales. Urban planning can play a substantial role to support the implementation of nature-based solutions and to manage trade-offs and conflicts, as well as how social equity dimensions are considered. This paper presents a framework that guides the application of urban planning to nature-based solutions’ implementation, by addressing key trade-offs across temporal, spatial, functional and social equity aspects. The framework highlights the key questions, and the supporting information required to address these questions, to underpin the inclusion of nature-based solutions for urban resilience. We find that while urban planning can contribute substantially, there are continuing gaps in how the inherently anthropocentric urban planning processes can give voice to non-human nature.},

	abstract = {The incidence of lung cancer is affected by air pollution, especially in high-density urban areas with heavy road traffic and dense urban form. Several studies have examined the direct relationship between lung cancer incidence and road traffic as well as urban form. However, the results are still inconsistent for high-density urban areas. This study focused on urban form and road traffic, aiming at revealing their relationship with lung cancer incidence in high-density urban areas at the neighborhood level. For this, an ecological study was conducted in downtown Shanghai to identify important indicators and explore quantitative associations. Negative binomial regression was fitted with lung cancer incidence as the dependent variable. The independent variables included indicators for road traffic and urban form, greenness, demographic, and socio-economic factors. The results showed that building coverage, averaged block perimeter area ratio, density of metro station without the glass barrier system, and the percentage of low-quality residential land were positively correlated with lung cancer incidence in the neighborhood, while population density was negatively correlated with lung cancer incidence. This study found a strong self-selection effect of socio-economic factors in the relationship between lung cancer incidence and greenness. These results may be useful for conducting health impact assessments and developing spatial planning interventions for respiratory health in high-density urban areas.},

	abstract = {As a complex social ecosystem network, the area along the Grand Canal has a prominent contradiction between the demand for economic development and the protection of natural resources, which means that there is an urgent need for ecological restoration and environmental protection. Using {ArcGIS}, Conefor, Linkage Mapper and other software platforms, this paper developed an integrated analysis framework, through loose coupling of the attribute-function-structure index system and a series of methods such as the least cost path, circuit theory and moving window search. Based on the framework, we resolve a series of scientific issues in developing regional ecological networks, such as the selection of ecological sources, the simulation of potential ecological corridors, the assessment of the importance of ecological sources and corridors, and the identification of key ecological nodes. Moreover, an overall conservation pattern of the regional ecological network is constructed. The results show that: 1) A total of 88 important ecological sources are identified in the study area. The patches with high centrality values are mainly concentrated in the southern mountainous area and the areas with abundant rivers and lakes. 2) A total of 138 important ecological corridors are identified, and they are not evenly distributed. Extremely important corridors mostly appear between important patches, and very important corridors are mainly distributed in the central area. 3) Fifteen ecological pinch points are extracted, and they are mainly concentrated in the northern part of the study area and eastern Zhejiang Province. The barriers are mostly concentrated in the southern and northern parts of the study area. 4) Combining the demands of ecological protection and socioeconomic development, we propose an overall ecological conservation pattern of “one axis, five sections, multiple cores and multiple nodes” to effectively guide future ecological restoration work. These results can provide a useful reference and spatial guidance for decision makers in terms of ecological restoration and cooperation on cross-regional ecological protection along the Grand Canal.},

We extracted the core area with good connectivity as the ecological sources with the methods of morphological spatial pattern analysis ({MSPA}) and landscape index with Guangzhou City as the study area. The ecological network was then constructed by minimal cumulative resistance ({MCR}) model and was quantitatively analyzed by gravity model and connectivity indices. After that, an optimized ecological network was finally constructed. The results showed that ten core patches could be used as ecological sources. In addition, eighteen important corridors as well as twenty-seven general corridors were identified, which were mainly distributed in the northeast part of the city. Five more ecological sources and thirteen more planning corridors were suggested under the optimized ecological network. Our results indicated that forests were the main composition of ecological corridors. The appropriate width for the important corridor and planning corridor was 60-100 m and 30-60 m, respectively. Our results provide scientific guidance for designing urban ecological network.},

	abstract = {The cooling effect of blue-green space has been recognized as a promising approach to mitigate the urban heat island ({UHI}), while the quantitative role (threshold-size for cooling) is still uncertain. This paper aims to present the latest progress and controversies on the studies of the cooling effects of waterbodies, greenspaces, and parks. In order to do this research, international search engines were employed to systematically search peer-reviewed articles, including the cooling effect of blue-green space and threshold-size-based {UHI} mitigation studies. After that, the inductive analysis is used to analyze the relevant literature. We found that previous studies concentrated on the correlations between different landscape types, temperature variations and the quantification of cooling intensity, etc. However, threshold-size-based research has received less attention, which limits the ability to make specific recommendations for actionable planning and management – usingthe smallest blue-green space for the best cooling effect. The review also revealed the controversies over the effects of blue-green space size, shape, landscape composition and configuration on cooling effect. Besides, we pointed out that the uncertainties (i.e., the optimal proportion of blue-green space in a park) and the reasons of controversial results of the cooling effect need to be further investigated. We also suggested that more attention should be paid to quantify the contributions of local background climate and landscape characteristics to the cooling effect (threshold-size) of blue-green space. This review would give us a deeper understanding of the field and provide insights into actionable climate adaption planning.},
